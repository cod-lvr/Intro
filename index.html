			<h4> Who I Am</h4>
			<section>
				<p> My name is William Trees, I was born and raised in Michigan where summer is only 2 months and winter is 10 months!
					All jokes aside Michigan is a beautiful state and the 21 years I have been alive I have learned a lot. I recently got
					married in October of 2021 and work full time as a water technician.

      <h3> About Me </h3>

          <h4>My Passion</h4>
          <section>
            <p> I have always been a 'tech nerd' but never really dove into the world of software development until earlier this year. I did my research on what I could do to make a career out of it and came across <a href = "https://www.thinkful.com//getstarted/all-topics-outcomes/?sf_campaign_id=7015b000005Df0DAAS&utm_campaign=7015b0000033JLoAAM&utm_medium=g&utm_content=&utm_term=GGL_Brand_Ex_GEO_Core&utm_source=google&keyword=thinkful&matchtype=e&adgroupid=125742843081&campaignid=13051883165&creativeid=520765092401&keywordid=303219710301&gclid=Cj0KCQiAhf2MBhDNARIsAKXU5GQPU9o_8lKdma6wL0Y619mTtstiMeuX6BlmtZbO7KQE8drgwvSgC9YaAqmLEALw_wcBThinkful" target = "_blank"> Thinkful</a>. My journey since has been amazing and learning something new everyday excites me as well as the amazing people I have met. My mentor being one of them has been so friendly and helpful. Going into the first meeting I was nervous but now I feel like I'm meeting with a friend each week!

          <h4>My Interests</h4>
          <section>
            <p> Outside of web development I love to spend time with my wife, play games, and hangout with friends for movie nights. My wife and I love the series "Survivor" that we watch on <a href = "https://www.hulu.com/welcome?orig_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F" target = "_blank"> Hulu</a>.

              <li>Valorant</li>
              <li>Skyrim</li>
              </ul>
              Finally my favorite movies to watch are action and adventure. My favorite are Marvel movies, in order they are: <ol> 
                <li>Avengers Endgame</li>
